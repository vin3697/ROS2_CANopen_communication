#ROS2 CANopen Communication

The repository used : https://github.com/ros-industrial/ros2_canopen/tree/galactic
Note: Galactic branch has been used.

I have extensively worked on 301 , 401 and 402 CiA Device Profile and I am very much familiar with the EDS file which are used by these device profile.
CiA 401 : Input Output Module
CiA 402 : Motor Control

The EDS file located at ros2_canopen-galactic/canopen_proxy/config/proxy has been edited by me accordingly so it functions properly with ROS2.
